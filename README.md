These are the resources for my [CF.Objective(ANZ) 2012](http://cfobjective.com.au/) presentation - "Adding Structure to ColdFusion Applications with FW/1: Beyond the Basics".

Demo code is not at all defensive, it is simply designed to demonstrate the concepts I talk about - so I would definitely NOT recommend trying to use this code in production, instead use it as a starting point for understanding these "advanced" features and how you can use them in your own projects.
